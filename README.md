  - **Using QR code**

  - **Scan QR code**

    This allows to scan and verify the mess QR codes. After selecting the meal type, upon hovering the camera over a mess QR code it shows a tick mark if the person has purchased coupon for the given meal on the given day. Or a cross mark if the person has not purchased the meal, or have already claimed it.
