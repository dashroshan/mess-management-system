## Problem statement

**D3H05**

Develop a solution for mess management. The solution should provide facilities to the mess admin and the students. For mess admins, they can manage coupons and other necessary details like menu, and pricing in the mess dashboard. Students can buy coupons from the mess dashboard only, deciding their desired meals for the week. The aim of the project will be to remove the hassle of buying coupons and provide a centralized platform for mess management.

- **Task 1 -** QR codes for each meal a day in place of paper coupons
- **Task 2 -** Razorpay Integration
